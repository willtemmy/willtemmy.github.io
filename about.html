In this genre, the main characters don’t usually stay in one place. They venture into several different places, usually with a goal in mind (e.g. searching for treasure, exploring some new place, defeating a heinous villain, or saving the world). Adventure anime are so broad and flexible that these shows can usually stretch to a huge number of episodes as well as overlap with multiple genres, usually with action.</p><br>
	    	<h2><u>Fantasy</u></h2>
	    	<p>The fantasy genre in anime primarily deals with fantasy worlds and surreal events and locations. Most of the time, the setting is in a magical world where the characters start an adventure. Sometimes they get sent there from the real world. Magic is oftentimes a component of this genre, and various mystical elements serve as the building blocks of the story.

Most of the time, its focus is on the advancement and development of science and technology. That is why you’ll often find sci-fi combined with subgenres such as mecha and space.</p>

	    		<p>Psycho-Pass is a smart series that deeply analyzes free will and whether or not a person’s “hue,” when cloudy, can determine if they will become a threat to society. Using a special weapon known as the Dominator, detectives are able to continuously read and send psychological data to determine a person’s crime coefficient.

	    		<p>This brilliant anime can be addicting for gamers thanks to its unique plot and concept of a fantasy world where almost everything is governed by specific rules which one must follow at all times. The two protagonists are siblings named Shiro and Sora, who are violently transported to a different world that is run by games, and where they must develop a lifestyle to survive in a world where games are not so cool and innocent.</p>

	    		<p>It is really difficult to sum up the story of a series with hundreds and hundreds of episodes, but we can guarantee you that the main character, Luffy, will provide you a meaningful life lesson. He will teach you that if you decide to accomplish something, you should give your all and fight to achieve your goal till the last moment of your life. This message alone makes this anime great.</p>
